Interactive React Tours Project

Explore travel destinations with this clean and interactive tours application built using React (with Vite).

- Fetches tour data asynchronously from course-api.com.
- Displays tours in a responsive grid layout using modern CSS.
- Features include individual tour removal ("Not Interested" button) and expandable descriptions ("Read More/Show Less").
- Handles loading states and provides an option to refresh the tour list if empty.
- Demonstrates component structure, state management (useState), side effects (useEffect), and event handling in React.

- The flow of the application looks like this:
- App.jsx fetches tours data from a URL and sets the state of the Tours component to store the data.
- The Tours component maps over the tours array and renders a Tour component for each tour.
- Each Tour component has a "remove tour" button and a "read more" button.When the "remove tour" button is clicked, the Tours component updates its state to remove the tour from the tours array.

- When the "read more" button is clicked, the Tour component updates its state to toggle a "read more" flag and conditionally renders the full description.

- When the "get-tours" button is clicked, the Tours component re-fetches the tours data from the URL and updates its state.
